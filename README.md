# Digest Authentication with IBM Integration Bus/App Connect

In this Code Pattern, we will learn how to build a service in IBM integration bus which can be exposed as a proxy to achieve digest authentication. We will learn how the digest authentication mechanism works in background and what logic needs to be built for a platform which doesn’t support digest authentication of its own. We will also learn how to expose the IIB service on a IBM cloud Kubernetes cluster and consume it via a sample client. Entire façade application and client application is built on IBM integration bus and deployed on Kubernetes node using a Docker image. 

When the reader has completed this code pattern, they will understand how to:
* Create a message flow and build logic for digest Authentication
* Deploy and test application locally 
* Deploy and test application expose the IIB service to Kubernetes

## Flow
1. User sends request to application. 
2. Application sends request to server seeking authorisation.
3. Request is rejected by the server asking for an authorisation and server responds with the details to create authorisation.
4. Application builds authorisation logic.
5. Application sends another request to server seeking authorisation. 
6. Request is successfully authorised. 
7. Application saves authorisation header or cookies in cache for next http request and respond with success.
8. User sends request to application.
9. Application sends request with cached data to server seeking authorisation.
10. Server authorises users.    
11. Success response sent back to user
